Extends Seriously Simple Podcasting to turn it into a powerful sermon management system.

== Description ==

Fixel Sermons serves as a base for sermon management + podcasting by extending Seriously Simple Podcasting + Seriously Simple Stats. Does not include any implementation for the front-end. If you're not a developer who knows how to create custom templates, you'd be best to look into other plugins.
